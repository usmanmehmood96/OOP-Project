Student Management System

Object-Oriented Programming, semester project.
The code has the same primary purpose as my previous (CP Project) Student Management System.

What’s different:
- Used Object Oriented Programming. All data is processed and temporarily stored in a 'student' class.
- Separated the file streaming code from the other code, into ‘ReadData’ and ‘WriteData’ functions.
- Less use of ‘goto’ statement, i.e., used it only once.
- The ‘student’ class can be renamed ‘member’ and converted into parent class with ‘student’ and ‘faculty’ as children classes.
- The code is much more optimized than before.
